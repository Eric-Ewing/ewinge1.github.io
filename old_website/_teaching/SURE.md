I mentored an undergraduate student on a research project investigating Quality Diversity (QD) for developing robust control policies for multi-robot systems. We sought to use QD methods to train a diverse set of control policies that would perform well under a number of different starting conditions. Her final presentation won a Best Presentation award at USC's Summer Research Symposium.
