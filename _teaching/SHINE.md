2020: I mentored two High School Students in the Summer High school Intensive Next generation Engineering (SHINE) program.
We worked on a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach to the multi-agent path finding problem (MAPF). 
The students and I covered an overview of the math required for deep RL for approximately 3 weeks, then created a MAPF environment and trained models to complete the problem for the remaining four weeks.
In addition to learning about RL, students also learned how to conduct research, including how to read papers, how to ask scientific questions, and how to present meaningful results.
