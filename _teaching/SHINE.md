I worked with the Summer High School Intensive Next generation Engineering (SHINE) program at USC for two years. The program takes high school students and matches them with PhD student mentors, who guide them in research projects. I mentored 3 students over the two years on MAPF related projects, including looking for reinforcement learning based solutions to MAPF. We covered a wide range of mathematical concepts required to understand and implement RL-based algorithms and then they implemented their own algorithms, trained agents, and assessed performance. In addition to learning about robotics, AI, and ML, students also learned how to conduct research, including how to read papers, how to ask scientific questions, and how to present meaningful results.
