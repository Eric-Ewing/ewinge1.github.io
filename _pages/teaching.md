Taking Art to the Skies: Summer@Brown Course
============================================
Throughout the Spring of 2023, I worked to develop a class to make multi-robot systems and drones more appealing and accessible to a wider audience. I wanted to take Crazyswarm(2), an active platform for research still very much in development, and make it stable and robust enough to be used in a classroom setting, where dependency and reliability are important. I believe art is the perfect medium for learning more about robotics. Just as a painter needs have very detailed knowledge about brush and paint types to make their art, so too must a robot artist develop a very detailed of their robots to succesfully make their art.

The result of these efforts was the Summer@Brown course "Taking Art to the Skies". We had 16 high school students come from over the world to study robotics, the very active relationship between art and technology, and ethics in AI and robotics. I will be co-teaching an undergraduate course in the Spring of 2024 with my advisor, Professor Nora Ayanian, in which we will go even farther beyond the content of the summer course to include painting drones, ground robots, and many other things as well.

If you use Crazyswarm2 and want to make it more accessible or have questions about the course, please reach out to me. I'm always happy to help make Crazyswarm or other robot platforms more accessible in an education setting.

SHINE: Summer Highschool Intensive in Next-generation Engineering, Mentor
=================================================================
I worked with the Summer High School Intensive Next generation Engineering (SHINE) program at USC for two years. The program takes high school students and matches them with PhD student mentors, who guide them in research projects. I mentored 3 students over the two years on MAPF related projects, including looking for reinforcement learning based solutions to MAPF. We covered a wide range of mathematical concepts required to understand and implement RL-based algorithms and then they implemented their own algorithms, trained agents, and assessed performance. In addition to learning about robotics, AI, and ML, students also learned how to conduct research, including how to read papers, how to ask scientific questions, and how to present meaningful results.

SURE: Summer Undergraduate Research Experience, Mentor
======================================================
I mentored an undergraduate student on a research project investigating Quality Diversity (QD) for developing robust control policies for multi-robot systems. We sought to use QD methods to train a diverse set of control policies that would perform well under a number of different starting conditions. Her final presentation won a Best Presentation award at USC's Summer Research Symposium.
