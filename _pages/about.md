I am a second year PhD student at the University of Southern California advised by Professor Nora Ayanian. My research focuses on coordination in multi-agent and multi-robot systems. My primary research studies how we can learn from the ways that humans coordinate, to design better controllers for coordinating robots. I also research machine learning for optimization within multi-agent systems.

Research Projects

#### Human-Coordination Inspired Robotics

We have collected data from a large number of people playing a single shape formation game without, which requires high levels of coordination without any form of explicit communication. From an AI perspective, this is a very hard task. Humans complete the task in a decentralized way, with limited information about the game state, with large numbers of participants, and no explicit communication, all of which create difficulties for traditional AI planners. But humans can not only complete the task, but can also do so robustly. This project focuses on learning from the way that humans coordinate, to build robotic systems that are also able to reason about high numbers of agents in a robust way.
