I am a second year PhD student at the University of Southern California advised by Professor Nora Ayanian. My research focuses on coordination in multi-agent and multi-robot systems. My primary research studies how we can learn from the ways that humans coordinate, to design better controllers for coordinating robots. I also research machine learning for optimization within multi-agent systems.
