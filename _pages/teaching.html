SURE 2020
<h1>
<p>
I mentored an undergraduate student on a research project investigating Quality Diversity (QD) for developing robust control policies for multi-robot systems.
We sought to use QD methods to train a diverse set of control policies that would perform well under a number of different starting conditions.
Her final presentation won a <b>Best Presentation award</b> at USC's Summer Research Symposium.

SHINE 2020
</h1>

<p>
I mentored two High School Students in the Summer High school Intensive Next generation Engineering (SHINE) program.
We worked on a multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) approach to the multi-agent path finding problem (MAPF).
The students and I covered an overview of the math required for deep RL for approximately 3 weeks, then created a MAPF environment and trained models to complete the problem for the remaining four weeks. In addition to learning about RL, students also learned how to conduct research, including how to read papers, how to ask scientific questions, and how to present meaningful results.
