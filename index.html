        <h2>Teaching</h2>
        <p>I've been teaching at Brown University since Spring 2024, first as a Teaching Fellow and now as a Visiting Assistant Professor. As a Visiting Assistant Professor at Brown University, I am committed to providing a high quality AI and Robotics education for students of all backgrounds.</p>

            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>In the Summer of 2023, I taught a course for the Summer@Brown program, which invites high school students from around the world to take classes at Brown.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Summer@Brown Taking Art to the Skies: Creating Art with Small Quadcopters</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Before entering my PhD program, I was a STEM Scholar Coach in Highland Park High School for the Schuler Scholar Program (which is very unfortunately now <a href="https://www.insidehighered.com/news/quick-takes/2024/08/02/schuler-scholar-program-abruptly-cancels-10m-aid">discontinued</a>)</p>

        <p>I taught multi-week after school programs on:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Decision Making and Game Theory</li>
            <li>Introduction to AI</li>
            <li>Data Literacy (with a focus on data use in media)</li>
            <li>Mathematical Problem solving and critical thinking</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Research</h2>

        <p>A full up to date list of publications is available on my google scholar page.</p>
        
        <h3>Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF)</h3>
        <p>My research advances the field of Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) by combining learning and optimization techniques.
        I've studied the empirical hardness of MAPF instances and what properties of instances are likely to make them harder to solve.
        I've worked on algorithm selection and other portfolio techniques within MAPF to advance the state-of-the-art in MAPF algorithms.</p>

        <h3>Robart</h3>
        <p>Robart is an online block programming environment for Crazyswarm2. The goal is to make programming multi-robot systems accessible to all.
            Robart is quick to learn, requires no additional software on student computers, and can program deeply complex behaviors. 
            The base trajectories that are available are to move in a straight line or a circle. Additional modifier blocks can be used to rotate, skew, stretch, or add multiple trajectories together.
            With these commands we can create a wide variety of interesting behaviors.</p>
        <p>The webapp is currently hosted <a href="https://act.usc.edu/MultiRobotArt/">here</a>.</p>

        <h2>Media and Outreach</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I've been featured in <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2024-02-15/eric-ewing">media</a> for my work creating CSCI 1952z.</li>
            <li>I've done media with Vicon about the Valkyrie camera system (links coming soon).</li>
            <li>A <a href="https://youtu.be/NLoQcquP-DE">video</a> of ours was presented at the Drones@SXSW panel at South by South West</li>
            <li>I gave an invited talk at <a href="https://www.washingtoninformer.com/amazon-drone-academy-howard-university/">Howard University's Drone Academy</a> on drone art.</li>
            <li>I've led many outreach programs at Brown University in the ACT Lab, from <a href="https://www.brown.edu/news/2024-08-19/girls-get-math-2024">Girls Get Math</a> to <a href="https://brown.learningu.org/">Brown's Splash</a> program.</li>
